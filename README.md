I am currently working at Leverify as Business Automation Executive. My work in this company is all based on Python and automations using Python.

I also work as a Junior SCADA Engineer at QANARE Engineering. Here my work is related industrial automation using ignition.

I have worked as a Research Intern at MERL - UIT. Where I was a part of the Hardware Design team. Got hands on experience on System verilog, Python and Linux commands.

I have great hands-on experience and knowledge on web development and Graphics Designing. Since, I have worked as a Freelancer and completed many projects of web development (frontend) and graphics designing. Through this i had a great experience on HTML5 and CSS3.

My area of interest includes Data Analysis and Automations using Python.

I know a number of programming languages in which i can code but one of my favorites and one of the languages in which i am an expert at, is PYTHON.

Seeking for more knowledge ahead to survive in my practical life and to work with full dedication, sincerity, and loyalty.
